# 🎮 Data Quest  
## Mastering Python Collections for Data Engineering

This repository contains all exercises for the **Data Quest: Mastering Python Collections for Data Engineering** project.  
The project focuses on strengthening Python fundamentals related to **data structures and collections**, applied to real-world game analytics scenarios.

You will build **PixelMetrics 3000**, a game analytics platform that processes scores, coordinates, achievements, inventories, and data streams using Python collections.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Master Python built-in collections: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- Understand when and why to use each data structure  
- Process command-line data efficiently  
- Apply generators for memory-efficient data streaming  
- Use comprehensions for concise and expressive data transformations  
- Build clean, readable, and maintainable Python programs  
- Strengthen computational thinking and data engineering foundations

## 📐 Rules and Style Guidelines

- Python **3.10 or higher**
- One exercise per directory
- Only allowed imports must be respected per exercise
- No file input/output (CLI arguments only)
- Code must be **flake8 compliant**
- Robust exception handling is required
- Focus on showcasing the strengths of each collection type

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Think in terms of **data flow**, not isolated scripts  
- Choose the correct data structure for each problem  
- Prefer clarity over clever tricks  
- Make sure you understand and can explain every line of code  
- Use IA tools responsibly and critically
