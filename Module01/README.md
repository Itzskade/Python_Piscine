# 🌱 Cultivating Code  
## Object-Oriented Harvesting Systems

This repository contains all exercises for the **Cultivating Code: Object-Oriented Harvesting Systems** project.  
This project builds upon Python fundamentals and introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through the creation of a complete digital ecosystem for managing community gardens.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand Python program structure and execution flow  
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming principles  
- Design reusable and extensible classes  
- Organize complex data structures efficiently  
- Implement encapsulation and data protection  
- Use inheritance to model real-world relationships  
- Work with instance, class, and static methods  
- Build scalable and maintainable software architectures

## 📐 Rules and Style Guidelines

- Python **3.10 or higher**
- One exercise per file
- Follow naming conventions:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions & variables: `snake_case`
- Include docstrings for classes, methods, and functions
- Type annotations are recommended
- Code must be **flake8 compliant**
- Programs must execute without errors
- Focus on clarity and correct use of OOP concepts

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Think in terms of systems, not isolated scripts  
- Avoid code duplication by using inheritance and composition  
- Protect sensitive data using encapsulation  
- Prefer clean architecture over quick solutions  
- Make sure you can explain every design decision
