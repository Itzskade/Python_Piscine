# 📂 Code Nexus  
## Polymorphic Data Flows in the Digital Matrix

This repository contains all exercises for the **Code Nexus Flow Engineering Program**.  
The project focuses on mastering **method overriding, subtype polymorphism, and advanced data pipeline design** in a dynamic digital matrix.

As a Flow Engineer, you will learn to **design adaptive digital organisms and pipelines** that process heterogeneous data streams in real time.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand and implement **method overriding** for specialized behaviors  
- Master **subtype polymorphism** in Python  
- Build flexible, adaptive **data processing pipelines**  
- Apply **object-oriented principles**: inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces  
- Ensure robustness with **error handling** and type annotations  
- Develop maintainable, scalable, and polymorphic Python programs

| Exercise | Description                              | Directory | Deliverable File          |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 00       | Data Processor Foundations               | ex0/      | stream_processor.py       |
| 01       | Polymorphic Streams                      | ex1/      | data_stream.py            |
| 02       | Nexus Pipeline Integration               | ex2/      | nexus_pipeline.py         |

## 📐 Rules and Best Practices

- Python **3.10 or higher**  
- One exercise per directory  
- Only authorized libraries allowed per exercise  
- Type annotations required for all functions and class attributes  
- Use **ABC** and `@abstractmethod` where applicable  
- Method overriding must be deliberate to demonstrate polymorphism  
- Robust error handling mandatory  
- Clean, readable, and well-documented code  

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Think in terms of **data flow and interfaces**, not isolated scripts  
- Design reusable classes with **polymorphic behaviors**  
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and scalability  
- Verify all AI-generated code and understand it fully  
- Collaborate and review with peers to strengthen solutions
