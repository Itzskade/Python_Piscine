# 📂 Data Archivist  
## Digital Preservation in the Cyber Archives

This repository contains all exercises for the **Cyber Archives Training Program**.  
The project focuses on strengthening skills in **file operations, data stream management, and digital security**, applied to critical information preservation scenarios.

As a Data Archivist, you will learn to **recover, create, protect, and manage digital files** to ensure the preservation of humanity's knowledge.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Master file operations: reading, writing, and secure management  
- Correctly manage data streams (input, output, and alerts)  
- Apply the `with` statement to prevent file corruption  
- Handle errors and crises using fail-safe protocols (`try/except`)  
- Build clean, robust, and professional Python programs  
- Understand and implement digital preservation principles

## 📐 Rules and Best Practices

- Python **3.10 or higher**  
- One exercise per directory  
- Only authorized libraries allowed per exercise  
- Correct handling of file input/output required  
- Clean, readable, and well-documented code  
- Robust error handling mandatory  
- Strict adherence to digital preservation protocols  

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Think in terms of **data flow**, not isolated scripts  
- Choose the correct data structure and method for each task  
- Prioritize clarity and security over clever tricks  
- Understand every line of code and its implications  
- Use AI tools responsibly and critically
