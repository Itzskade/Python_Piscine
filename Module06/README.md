# 📜 The Codex  
## Mastering the Mysteries of Python Imports

This repository contains all exercises for **The Codex: Alchemical Python Imports**.  
The project guides you through **the four sacred mysteries of Python imports**: package initialization, import paths, absolute vs. relative imports, and breaking circular dependencies.

As a Python Alchemist, you will **organize scattered code into magical packages**, invoke specific spells (functions) efficiently, and avoid the traps of circular dependencies.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand and control `__init__.py` (The Sacred Scroll)  
- Master `from ... import` for selective spell invocation  
- Learn absolute vs relative import strategies  
- Identify and break circular dependency curses  
- Build packages with robust error handling and type hints  
- Write clean, organized, and maintainable Python code

## 📐 Rules and Best Practices

- Python **3.10+** required  
- One exercise per directory  
- Only standard library modules allowed  
- No `eval()`, `exec()`, or external packages  
- Keep functions simple, returning **strings**  
- Apply **type hints** everywhere  
- Handle errors gracefully with `try/except`  
- Use `__init__.py` to expose only intended functions  

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Think in terms of **package-level organization**, not just scripts  
- Use imports to invoke only what you need  
- Demonstrate understanding of absolute vs relative paths  
- Prevent circular dependencies with deferred imports or dependency injection  
- Validate all AI-generated code and understand every line  
- Collaborate with peers to reinforce learning
