# 🌱 Cultivating Code  
## Python Fundamentals Through Community Garden Data

This repository contains all the exercises for the **Cultivating Code** project, an introductory project designed to teach the fundamentals of **Python 3** using realistic scenarios based on community gardens.  
The project covers essential concepts such as standard input/output, variables, conditionals, loops, recursion, and basic type annotations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand basic Python syntax  
- Learn how to define and use functions  
- Work with standard input and output (`input` / `print`)  
- Use conditionals and loops  
- Introduce recursion in a practical way  
- Apply basic type annotations  
- Write clean, readable code following good practices

## 📐 Rules and Style Guidelines

- Python **3.10 or higher**
- One file per exercise
- Each file must contain **only the required function**
- Do not use `if __name__ == "__main__":`
- No input validation or error handling required (undefined behavior)
- Code must be **flake8** compliant
- Type annotations are optional (mandatory in exercise 7)

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Make sure you understand every line you write — explanations may be required during evaluation  
- Use clear and descriptive function and variable names  
- Keep functions simple and focused  
- Review logic and understanding with your peers
